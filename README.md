# PacMan Factory
## About:
The goal of this project is to create a PacMan Factory. Each time the user clicks the Add PacMan button, a new image of PacMan will appear on the screen. Each additional image will move at a random velocity.
## Steps for Use:
In order to use this project, you can fork and clone this repository to make any updates. 
## Future Improvements:
In the future, I'd like to add a fifth image, the PacMan ghost, to the array. When the ghost is the randomly chosen image, all of the PacMen that have been added will disappear and the game can start over.

This project comes from a course provided by Emeritus X MIT.
